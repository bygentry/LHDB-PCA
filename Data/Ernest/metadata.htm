<p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>INTRODUCTION</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Understanding the patterns and processes 
  of the evolution of life history strategies is a major theme in evolutionary 
  biology. The study of life histories often involves comparing and contrasting 
  life history characteristics of groups of species, taking into account phylogeny 
  and sometimes ecology. Because of the time and effort required to collect life 
  history data from the literature, many studies that compare across gross taxonomic 
  groups, such as orders, have relatively low sample sizes within each group. 
  As with many studies attempting to find general patterns by comparing across 
  species, large data sets for a diversity of species from numerous continents, 
  habitats, and taxonomic groups are useful for addressing these questions. This 
  data set was collected to facilitate addressing questions on general patterns 
  of mammalian life history characteristics.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">This data paper documents the development 
  of a life history data set created for the purpose of exploring general patterns 
  of non-volant placental mammalian life history. Information on nine life history 
  characteristics was collected from the literature for 17 orders within the Class 
  Mammalia. Orders not represented in this data set include Chiroptera and non-placental 
  mammals. Chiroptera was not included because an extensive, high quality database 
  has recently been published (K. E. Jones, A. Purvis, J. L. Gittleman. 2003. 
  American Naturalist <b>161</b>:601–614). Non-placental mammals were not 
  included because of their radically different life history. While there is a 
  taxonomic restriction in the data set, there is no geographic restriction. Terrestrial 
  and aquatic species are both heavily represented in this data set, as are all 
  major continents. Species represent a variety of trophic levels, habitats, and 
  ecologies.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">One of the challenges in compiling 
  a life history data set for mammals is that life history characteristics can 
  change with environmental conditions. Here, I attempted to create a general 
  life history for each species by drawing from a variety of sources for each 
  life history variable. Therefore, the life histories in this data set are not 
  integrated life histories of a population but should be considered a general 
  life history of the species. </font></p>

  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Abstract:</b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The purpose of this dataset was 
	to compile general life history characteristics for a variety of mammalian 
	species to perform comparative life history analyses among different taxa 
	and different body size groups. Data were collected from the literature and 
	data sources are documented for each species within the data file. Since life 
	history characteristics will show minor variation with environmental conditions 
	(resource availability, climate, competitive environment, and predation pressure) 
	a general life history for each species was sought to average over minor differences 
	in local populations. To create a general life history for each species, life 
	history values are often an average from several literature sources. Life 
	history variables included in the data set are: Maximum life span (months), 
	Age of First Reproduction (months), Gestation time (months), Weaning age (months), 
	Weaning Mass (grams), Litter size (months), litters per year, new born mass 
	(grams), and adult body mass (grams). Since these data were collected with 
	the intent to examine general life history patterns, these data are good for 
	examining large-scale patterns, specifically in comparing life history characteristics 
	for different orders or families of mammals. All orders of placental mammals, 
	except Chiroptera (bats) are represented in this data set: Artiodactyla (161 
	species), Carnivora (197), Cetacea (55 species), Dermoptera (2 species), Hydracoidea 
	(4 species), Insectivora (91 species), Lagomorpha (42 species), Macroscelidea 
	(10 species), Perissodactyla (15 species), Pholidota (7 species), Primates 
	(156 species), Proboscidea (2 species), Rodentia (665 species), Scandentia 
	(7 species), Sirenia (5 species), Tubulidentata (1 species), and Xenarthra 
	(20 species). There are two caveats on this data set, however. First, these 
	data are not appropriate for asking population-level questions where the integration 
	of life history parameters with specific environmental conditions is important. 
	Second, while this data set is extensive, it is not exhaustive. The creation 
	of an exhaustive data set is the ultimate goal, but that goal is still several 
	years from completion. In the meantime, researchers utilizing the data set 
	are urged to conduct their own search for data not reported within the current 
	dataset. Researchers are also encouraged to contact the author of the dataset 
	and alert her to literature sources containing data for missing variables 
	or species. The updated data set will be made available to <i>Ecological Archives</i> 
	periodically. </font></p>

<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Site description:</b> Data 
	were obtained from species from a variety of habitats, geologies, hydrologies, 
	etc. This is a worldwide data set, including species from all continents and 
	all major habitat types.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Experimental or sampling design:</b> 
	Data were obtained from published sources written by mammalogists. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Research Methods:</b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Field/Laboratory: </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><i>Data Sources</i>: Data were 
	collected from published sources written by experienced mammalogists. References 
	for data sources are found in Class IV Data Structural Descriptors, Section 
	B. These sources are numerically indexed in the references column of the data 
	set. Reference numbers refer to the order in which these data sources were 
	entered into the dataset. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><i>Data Collection: </i>Each life 
	history variable in the data set is a compilation from many data sources. 
	The use of multiple sources reduces the influence of erroneous data points 
	and yields an overall average for the species across environmental conditions. 
	The original data set is in MSExcel format and each life history cell is set 
	up with the Average function which continually recalculates the average as 
	new data is entered into the cell. The resulting average across all sources 
	entered is what is available in the text data file Mammal_lifehistories_v2. 
	This method was not used for Maximum Life Span (see <i>Life History Variables</i> 
	in this section)</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Different data sources contain 
	different forms of data, ranging from raw data from numerous individuals, 
	to summarized data in the forms of averages and ranges. If averages were available 
	these were entered preferentially. Raw data were used to calculate an average 
	which was then used in the dataset. If only ranges were available, the midpoint 
	of the range was entered. Ranges were only used if no other data were available 
	for that life history variable in that data source. Due to the size and complexity 
	of the database, each source is treated as an independent estimate and sample 
	sizes are not factored into the average.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Since most data came from other 
	compilations, it is very difficult to ensure that the same primary literature 
	source was not used multiple times. However, data were not used if the citation 
	for it matched a reference already in the reference list for the data set.&nbsp; 
	Since many species have only a couple of citations and the number of numerically 
	identical entries for a life history variable is small, this is unlikely to 
	have a major influence on the results. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">After the entry data from reference 
	26, a new rule was implemented for data collection. Since time and resources 
	are limited, continuing to collect data for species with well-characterized 
	life history variables (i.e., 10 or more estimates for a life history variable) 
	lead to decreased efficiency. Therefore, after any specific life history variable 
	for a specific species reaches 10 entries, it is determined to be well characterized 
	and data collection for that variable for that species stops.&nbsp; This number 
	was chosen because after 10 entries, the average changes very little with 
	each new entry and when there are more than 10 entries the probability of 
	duplicating a source increases. Since this rule was not implemented until 
	the entry of reference 26, there are still a number of species with life history 
	variables characterized by &gt;10 entries.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><i>Life History Variables</i>: 
	Nine life history variables were collected. This section contains the specific 
	definitions used in collecting these data.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><u>Maximum life span:</u> Maximum 
	life span (months) is the oldest age recorded for a member (male or female) 
	of that species. Maximum life span, unlike the other variables, represents 
	a single datapoint <i>not an average</i>. If a longer maximum life span is 
	found than the number currently in the database, then the previous datapoint 
	is replaced with the new value.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><u>Age of First Reproduction (AFR):</u> 
	AFR is the age (months) at which a female individual of the species first 
	breeds and could potentially conceive. By definition, this is only recorded 
	for females. This variable does not include gestation. If the age of first 
	birth is given by a data source then gestation length was subtracted from 
	the value to yield an estimate of first breeding. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><u>Gestation length:</u> Gestation 
	(months) is the length of active gestating of a fetus. Gestation length does 
	not include the period of delayed implantation. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><u>Weaning length:</u> Weaning 
	length (months) is the time from the birth of an offspring to the independence 
	of that offspring from milk. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><u>Weaning mass:</u> Weaning mass 
	(grams) is the weight of a single offspring at the time of independence from 
	milk. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><u>Litter size:</u> The number 
	of offspring birthed in a single litter. If a data source indicated that its 
	litter size estimate was based on embryo counts or reproductive scars, it 
	was excluded since it is relatively common for a subset of embryos in a litter 
	to be resorbed. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><u>Litter frequency:</u> The number 
	of litters birthed by a female in a 12-month period. Captive studies attempting 
	to maximize litter production were excluded as possible. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><u>Neonate mass:</u> The weight 
	(grams) of a single newborn offspring. If a data source indicated that the 
	mass of the newborn was taken &gt; 12 hours after birth it was excluded. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><u>Adult mass:</u> The weight 
	(grams) of a reproductive adult. If strong sexual dimorphism exists in a species, 
	then only data sources specifying female weight were included. References 
	16 and 18 were only used for body masses. Furthermore, these references were 
	only used if other body mass estimates were not available from the sources 
	which supplied life history data. </font></p>

<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">A major overhaul of the life history 
	data set, which was formerly known as AFR3.xls, occurred over the summer of 
	2002. The current version reflected an addition of a new life history variable, 
	weaning mass, and many species not represented in AFR3.xls. The paper published 
	by E. L. Charnov (2001) used data from AFR3.xls. The manuscript by M. E. Moses 
	and J. H. Brown uses the previous data set Mammal_lifehistories_v1. (See publications 
	and results).</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Special thanks to Eric Charnov for 
  challenging me to explore mammalian life histories and for consultation during 
  the development of the data set (though any errors are mine, not his!), K. E. 
  Jones for extensive discussions on life histories and databases, and to S. K. 
  Lyons for allowing me to raid her library.</font></p>
